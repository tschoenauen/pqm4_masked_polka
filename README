1) Go on bash and then clean clone/copy from pqm4_masked (dont forget the --recursive)

2) Copy all the files from this directory to the root of pqm4_masked
The following copy must do the job (once run from 'pqm4_masked/'

'cp -f /common/4thib/* .'

3) Install openocd by running 'bash install-openocd.sh' 
Once done, check if 'openocd --version' shows a version of openocd >=12

4) Setup the environment by running 'bash setup.sh'
This command shoud create the python virutal env and install dependencies. It also is supposed 
to build the lipopencm3 library 

5) Once done, you should be able to run the following command.  

```
./run_bench.sh kyber768
# For assembly implementation
python3 parse_bench.py kyber768 asm 16
# For pure C implementation
python3 parse_bench.py kyber768 c 16
```

Using these commands, the file 'report-bench-cycles.pdf' must be generated once finished. 
You can download it on your pc to see it using the scp utilitary.


CAUTION: 
- The board is connected to '/dev/ttyACM1' (Bus 005 Device 010: ID 0483:374b
  STMicroelectronics ST-LINK/V2.1). It is normally configured in run_bench.sh,
  but you might need to adapt the commands displayed in
  'https://github.com/uclcrypto/pqm4_masked' (e.g., change ttyACM0 to ttyACM1) 
- the script 'pars_bench.py' provided on the repo is outdated. Please use the
  provided script parse_bench.py instead.
