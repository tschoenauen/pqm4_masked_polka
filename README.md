# pqm4_masked
Post-quantum masked crypto library for the ARM Cortex-M4

## Introduction
The **pqm4\_masked** library is based on [pqm4](https://github.com/mupq/pqm4).

The main differences are
* the addition of masked implementations of the following schemes:
    - Kyber768 (in `crypto_kem/kyber768/m4fspeed_masked`, tested on the `nucleo-l4r5zi` target);
    **/!\\This implementation is provided for demonstration and benchmarking purposes.
    It has NOT been subjected to any leakage assessment. Use it at your own risk./!\\**
    - SABER (in `crypto_kem/saber/m4fspeed_masked`, tested on the `nucleo-l4r5zi` target);
    **/!\\This implementation is provided for demonstration and benchmarking purposes.
    It has NOT been subjected to any leakage assessment. Use it at your own risk./!\\**

* some changes in the tooling to allow for finer-grained benchmarking and testing
  (for this, we use a slightly modified version of the `mupq` submodule located
  at <https//github.com/uclcrypto/mupq>).

## Setup/Installation

Same as [pqm4](https://github.com/mupq/pqm4).


## API documentation
For the purpose of simple testing and benchmarking, the **pqm4\_masked**
library uses the NIST/SUPERCOP/[PQClean
API](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean).
(See [pqm4](https://github.com/mupq/pqm4).)

**/!\\As a result, the secret key is stored unmasked, which is insecure./!\\**


## Running tests and benchmarks

In addition to pqm4 common testing (`testvectors.py` and benchmarking `benchmarking.py`), `pqm4\_masked` supports:
* testing a single implementation (e.g. `kyber768/m4fspeed_masked` as command-line parameter)
* benchmarking components of the masked implementation `subspeed` in `benchmarks.py`

### Example usages

Before running any code, run `cd libopencm3; make; cd ..`, otherwise the scripts fail.

```shell
# Testvectors
CFLAGS="-DNSHARES=2" python3 testvectors.py -p nucleo-l4r5zi --uart /dev/ttyACM0 kyber768/m4fspeed_masked
# Benchmark whole
CFLAGS="-DNSHARES=2 -DBENCH=1" python3 benchmarks.py -p nucleo-l4r5zi --uart /dev/ttyACM0 kyber768/m4fspeed_masked --speed
# Benchmark components
CFLAGS="-DNSHARES=2 -DBENCH=1" python3 benchmarks.py -p nucleo-l4r5zi --uart /dev/ttyACM0 kyber768/m4fspeed_masked --subspeed
```
