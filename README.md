# pqm4_masked_polka

Derived from pqm4_masked in the context of my master thesis "_Implementation of a post-quantum encryption scheme with physical security guarantees_".

POLKA's implementation can be found in crypto_kem/polka/m4fspeed_masked

The command ./run_all_bench.sh 30 was used to generate the benchmarks used in the paper.
